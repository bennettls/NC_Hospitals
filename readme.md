**Interactive Bivariate Map**

I designed an interactive web map of hospital locations in North Carolina. The map incorporated multiple variables that came together to form an aesthetically    pleasing and comprehensible choropleth map.  

_Major Functions_

1.	Exact location of every hospital in North Carolina
2.	Number of hospitals per county in North Carolina
3.	Clickable icons showing the name of each hospital
4.	North Carolina state and county boundary polygons
5.	Point marker and polygon visualization
6.	Legend with sequential color palette
7.	Scale bar and source information 

_Libraries & Data Sources_

1.	Atom Text Editor
2.	Font Awesome
3.	ColorBrewer
4.	Leaflet basemap provided by CartoDB
5.	Hospital locations shapefile acquired from NC OneMap
6.	North Carolina state and county boundary polygons shapefile acquired from NC OneMap   
7.	QGIS (Shapefile to GeoJSON conversion and points in polygon calculation)
